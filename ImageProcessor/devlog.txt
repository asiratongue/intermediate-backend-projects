123> i had to update the bucket policy, under the permissions tab of my imageprocessingbucket2 s3 bucket.
the bucket policy allows for public access to the images directory for my ImageProcessing app, before, it was returning an access denied error.

124> set the cache in the settings.py file, redis cache.

124> implemented etags for caching unedited images to redis, so faster retrival can be had, and the s3 bucket is only queried once for the initial image retrival.
had to convert the raw binary image data stored in the s3 cache into a pil image with bytesio. 

125> use the new method SimpleUploadedFile, from django library to test file uploads, use Path also, to create a valid path; learnt a path object has attributes.
