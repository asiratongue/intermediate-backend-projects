# A Scalable E-Commerce Platform, AKA "ShopShop" üõíüõçÔ∏èüòä
"ShopShop" is an E-Commerce Backend Platform using a microservices architecture, allowing users to sign up, view,
cart, and pay for products. Users are notified of purchase and order information via SMS and Email.


ShopShop was built using Django and DRF for back end, Posgresql as the db, Celery, Django Signals, and Redis for message queues + internal service communication, 
and Docker-Compose for containerization.
The ELK Stack is used for centralised logging and data visualisation, while Prometheus with Grafana is used for CPU/Memory Metrics.
The API gateway is handled with nginx, proxying requests to appropriate services.
