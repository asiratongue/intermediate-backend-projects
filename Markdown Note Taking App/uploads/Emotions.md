Thoughts with no emotion to them are like gas with no car,
Feeling is 40-60x stronger than thought or word.

Emotion beats thought, verbose chatter, thoughts are gay,
thoughts are for pussios . . . 

your emotions are more connected to you than you think, 
AND
your emotions are more connected to you than you think . . . 

**LOVE = HIGHER VIBRATIONS = CLOSER TO SOURCE ENERGY/GOD =**
**LESS TALK MORE CREATIVITY**
**FEELING = HOLOGRAM SUPERIMPOSED ON REALITY
